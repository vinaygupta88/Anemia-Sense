# Anemia Sense - ML Based Anemia Detection System
Anemiasense leverages machine learning algorithms to provide precise recognition and management of anemia, a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin.

Anemia Sense is a machine learning-powered diagnostic tool designed to predict anemia using user-input health parameters. This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can aid early diagnosis, especially in regions with limited access to healthcare facilities.

## 🔬 Project Overview

Anemia is a serious global health issue, especially among women and children. This application leverages a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of anemia based on key biological metrics like:

- Age  
- Hemoglobin levels  
- Blood pressure  
- Red blood cell count  
- Serum ferritin, and more

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Machine Learning model trained with healthcare datasets  
- 📊 User-friendly web interface to input test data  
- 🔍 Real-time prediction of anemia (Anemic / Not Anemic)  
- 🌐 Flask-based lightweight backend  
- 🎨 Responsive HTML/CSS frontend
